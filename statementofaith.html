    <p><h1>Following christ</h1></p>
    <p>God, our Creator, loves us and calls us into a loving relationship with Himself. 
        But our human inclination to do wrong—that is, to sin—separates us from Him. 
        He is holy—set apart—and sin separates us from Him, preventing us from knowing Him in an intimate way.
        <br>The Bible says,<h4>“God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
        that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life” (John 3:16).*</h4>
        <br> The Bible also says that<br>
        <h4>“All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23).</h4>
        One day every action and deed will be brought to account and given its rightful reward or punishment,
        <h4>“For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,
        that everyone may receive what is due them for the things done while in the body,
        whether good or bad” (2 Corinthians 5:10).</h4><br>
        But we can escape judgment by putting our trust in Christ, who took on the punishment that we deserve.
        We can have complete forgiveness for the wrongs we have done in our lives,
        and be assured of fellowship with God here on earth and for all eternity,
        by entering into a personal relationship with Christ, by faith.
        It’s as simple as believing that Jesus is the Son of God,
        that He came to live on the earth in human form, suffered and then died on a cross for our sins,
        and was raised again to life again on the third day—and then specifically inviting Him into our
        lives in a personal way, committing ourselves to His complete rule and Lordship in our lives.
        Jesus said, <h4>“I am the way and the truth and the life.
        No one comes to the Father except through Me” (John 14:6).</h4>
        <br> The Bible also says, <h4>“To all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name,
        he gave the right to become children of God” (John 1:12).</h4>
        <br> When we receive Christ, our lives change. We become a new creation <h4>(2 Corinthians 5:17).</h4>
        <br> We enjoy an intimate relationship with God the Father.
        We learn to hear His voice, and receive direction for our lives.<br>
        Jesus also said, <h4>“Here I am! I stand at the door and knock.
        If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with them,
        and they with me” (Revelation 3:20).</h4> When you feel a desire to draw nearer
        to God or to learn more about Christ, you can “open the door” by asking Christ
        to be Lord of your life in your own words. If you’re not sure what to say, try this prayer:
        <h4>“Lord Jesus, I need You. I am sorry for all the wrong things I have done in my life.
        Thank You for dying on the cross for my sins. I open the door of my life and receive You as
        my Saviour and Lord. Thank You for forgiving me and giving me eternal life.
        Take control of every area of my life. Make me the kind of person You want me to be.”</h4>
        God responds to all who genuinely seek Him in faith. If you have prayed in this way,
        trust Him to begin to work in your heart and life as He has promised, and to reveal Himself to you.

  <h1>Growing in Faith</h1>
        <p>Living for Christ is the most life changing and rewarding decision you will ever make.
        A relationship with Him enriches every area of your life, and impacts the way you perceive
        and interact with the world—including your family, your friends, and your community.<br>
        Believers at every stage of their journey with Jesus benefit from continued encouragement
        and intentional discipleship—the process of learning how to become more like Christ.
        Every Day Faith is a discipleship ethos encouraged by the PAOC to help churches and
        individuals remain inspired to engage in established practices that help us remain
        grounded in our relationship with the Lord and with each other. For regular updates that
        will help any reader to learn more about becoming all that Christ calls us to be, visit:</p>
